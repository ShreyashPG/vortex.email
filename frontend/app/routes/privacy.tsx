                We may use the information we collect for various purposes, including
                to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our service</li>

            <p>
                As stated above, we retain emails indefinitely until you choose to
                delete them manually from our system. You have control over the removal
                of your email data at any time through the "Clear all emails" button in

            <h2 id="5-data-security">5. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information
                from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Access
                to emails requires knowledge of the randomly generated email username
                and domain. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or
                electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute
                security.

                full control over your email data and can delete all stored emails at
